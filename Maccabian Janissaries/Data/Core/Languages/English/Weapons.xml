	<entry name="MaccabianLasgunFlavor" value="Maccabian Janissaries are armed with anointed lasguns for their crusades. On Maccabeus Quintus, tech-priests of the Adeptus Mechanicus and preachers of the Adeptus Ministorum have crafted a pipeline of prayers for these weapons. Based on the standard M36 Pattern Lasguns, these lasguns are taken through numerous holy rituals in honour of Saint Drusus, which ends in anointing with sacred oils and attaching a third-class relic to the receiver. The resulting lasgun resembles a boltgun in appearance, in honour of its holy status. These blessed weapons, carried by the pious crusaders, shine the Emperor's Light and Wrath upon any unholy forces."/>
