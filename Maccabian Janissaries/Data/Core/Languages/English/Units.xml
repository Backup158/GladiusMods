	<entry name="AstraMilitarum/MaccabianJanissaryFlavor" value="Maccabian Janissaries are selected from the finest warriors of the Shrine World of Maccabeus Quintus. They are clad in enclosed carapace armour, with the helmet carrying a faceplate bearing the visage of Saint Drusus. Every Janissary is a volunteer, fully devoted in surrendering their lives in the Name of the Emperor. So fierce is their devotion that Maccabian Janissaries are known to demand high command to send them far off to the most treacherous battlefields, never expecting to return home. The nightmarish hellscape of war is simply a pilgrimage for these stubborn zealots, and that stubbornness does not stop when the battle begins. The fanatical crusaders march shoulder-to-shoulder, unleashing the holy wrath and judgement of the Emperor upon His foes. Precise las-fire spits from anointed lasguns, which appear like bolters, while grenade launchers rain down a blessed array of ordnance. Unshakeable is their faith; immeasurable, their hatred of Chaos."/>
