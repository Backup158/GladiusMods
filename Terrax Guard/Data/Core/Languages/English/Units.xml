	<entry name="AstraMilitarum/TerraxGuardsmanDescription" value="Elite infantry geared for close combat. Half the squad is equipped with Meltaguns as special weapons. Can inspire and execute adjacent troops."/>
	<entry name="AstraMilitarum/TerraxGuardsmanFlavor" value="Even the lowest Guardsman on Terrax is trained at the Schola Progenium, where they are treated as if they were training to be Commissars. They're even equipped with carapace armour. When every soldier is instilled with deep discipline and a duty to keep their allies accountable, other regiments have come to refer to the Terrax Guard as a regiment of Commissars."/>
	<entry name="AstraMilitarum/TerraxStormTrooper" value="Terrax Storm Trooper"/>
	<entry name="AstraMilitarum/TerraxStormTrooperDescription" value="Elite close combat infantry with volatile anti-armour weapons. Plasma Pistols can be overcharged for further deadly effect. Can inspire and execute adjacent troops."/>
	<entry name="AstraMilitarum/TerraxStormTrooperFlavor" value="Bravery and discipline are paramount when it comes to handling plasma weapons. While most regiments will have squads carry only one plasma gun, Terrax Storm Troopers have proven themselves worthy of equipping the entire squad with plasma weaponry. Upon graduation, each storm trooper is granted permission to carry a Power Sword to symbolise their elevated status. As such, storm troopers are inseparable from their swords, so their preferred ranged weapon is the plasma pistol. Enemy infantry are sliced apart, while enemy vehicles are melted by well-dispersed blobs of plasma. It also accentuates the effect of summary executions, as turning cowards into bubbling puddles of flesh makes quite a statement."/>
	<entry name="AstraMilitarum/TerraxLascannonSquad" value="Terrax Lascannon Squad"/>
	<entry name="AstraMilitarum/TerraxLascannonSquadDescription" value="Elite ranged infantry with anti-armour weapons. Can inspire adjacent troops. Can execute troops within 3 tiles, including vehicles."/>
	<entry name="AstraMilitarum/TerraxLascannonSquadFlavor" value="The Terrax Guard's advanced equipment makes dealing with infantry a simple matter. The main concern then becomes dealing with vehicles, which has led to Terraxians favouring Meltaguns and Lascannons as supporting weapons. Regimental pride means even supporting weapons cannot be manned by common militia, thus forming the Terrax Lascannon training corps. Unfortunately for any cowards, this means fleeing in a tank won't save you from the Emperor's judgement."/>

	<entry name="AstraMilitarum/TerraxColonel" value="Terrax Colonel"/>
	<entry name="AstraMilitarum/TerraxColonelDescription" value="Elite Hero unit that provides bonuses to nearby allied units, with further effects for members of the Terrax Guard."/>
	<entry name="AstraMilitarum/TerraxColonelFlavor" value="Terrax Colonels have risen through the ranks and proven that they can command and craft leaders. As part of selection, they undergo storm trooper training and deployment to strengthen their resolve. Candidates then enter the advanced officers class, after which they lead multiple squads into battle. This final test determines their path. Failure means being stripped of rank and remaining in the infantry, unless they can prove they have proficiency in logistics. Success puts them into a final officer training class to become a Colonel, where graduation bestows them a power fist to symbolise the grip they must maintain onto power. In remembrance of their time in the storm troopers, Colonels typically continue to brandish their power swords even after this, with some even wielding both in battle. While they are given blessed Bolt Pistols to enforce their authority, many Colonels prefer to assign execution duties to their underlings. However, if the crime is dire enough, Terrax Colonels have been known to personally execute traitors by fisting them until blood and viscera are strewn about, filling the newly-formed cracks in the walls and floor."/>
