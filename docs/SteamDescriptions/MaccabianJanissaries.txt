Adds the Maccabian Janissaries to the Astra Militarum. 

From the Shrine World of Maccabeus Quintus, voidships arrive on Gladius Prime, bringing the Maccabian Janissaries. These holy crusaders are the best volunteers of the world, clad in enclosed carapace armour with a faceplate bearing the visage of Saint Drusus. Every Janissary is a volunteer, fully devoted in surrendering their lives in the Name of the Emperor. So fierce is their devotion that Maccabian Janissaries are known to demand high command to send them far off to the most treacherous battlefields, never expecting to return home. The nightmarish hellscape of war is simply a pilgrimage for these stubborn zealots, and that stubbornness does not stop when the battle begins. The fanatical crusaders march shoulder-to-shoulder, unleashing the holy wrath and judgement of the Emperor upon His foes. Precise las-fire spits from anointed lasguns, which appear like bolters, while grenade launchers rain down a blessed array of ordnance. Unshakeable is their faith; immeasurable, their hatred of Chaos.

[td]T8 [b]Relic Plating[/b][/td][td][b]Maccabian Janissaries[/b] - Elite infantry equipped with heavy-duty lasguns, with half the squad holstering versatile grenade launchers. Unit needs to pray to remain effective. Specialised against the forces of Chaos.
To be a [i]Maccabian Janissary[/i] is to despise the archenemy. When facing the forces of Chaos, Janissaries have steadied aim, though the enemy retaliates with great ferocity[spoiler](+17% accuracy when shooting them, but +17% damage taken)[/spoiler]. In battle, lines of Janissaries march forward, forming a carapace wall of death[spoiler](When adjacent to one unit with [i]Maccabian Janissary[/i], gain +17% ranged accuracy; when adjacent to two, gain +10% ranged attacks)[/spoiler]. When holding the line, their sacred discipline lets them deliver a flurry of las bolts[spoiler](If unit has not moved, Rapid Fire applies at range 2)[/spoiler].
On construction, Janissaries are affected by [i]Warp Travel Sickness[/i][spoiler](-67% movement and -50% accuracy)[/spoiler], which is removed upon praying. This is simply to enforce the prayer requirement. It will not return after the first prayer. Speaking of which... 
[u]Pray[/u]: Spends an action to praise the Emperor. Grants [i]Prayed[/i] for 4 turns, holy protection for one turn[spoiler]([i]Intercession of Saint Drusus[/i]: 67% WDR, 33% RDR, and 17% MDR)[/spoiler], and a small amount of morale. Use this ability to maintain the effects of [i]Prayed[/i], lest you suffer the Emperor's Judgement[spoiler](upon letting [i]Prayed[/i] decay, lose all morale and half the squad)[/spoiler]. There's not much visual feedback on this so right now, you just need to keep an eye on the trait. I'm looking into that.
While praying is its own reward, the God-Emperor rewards His followers with protection[spoiler]([i]Prayed[/i]: +2 max morale, +17% FNP, and +33% WDR)[/spoiler].
[u]Use Grenade Launcher[/u]: Fire grenade launchers, using the specified ammo type. Krak for anti-armour, frag for anti-infantry on open ground, and immolation for anti-infantry in cover. Only half the squad carries grenade launchers, but the blessed explosives are more effective than typical[spoiler](halved attacks but doubled damage)[/spoiler]. Each ammo is on a shared cooldown of 3 turns.

No custom models. Chances of me making them are slim (because I'm lazy and don't want to learn Blender).

The AI cannot use [u]Prayed[/u] intelligently, so I have exempted it from this minigame. AI-controlled Maccabian Janissaries are not affected by [i]Warp Travel Sickness[/i], and they have a permanent, reduced version of the benefits from [i]Prayed[/i][spoiler](+2 max morale, +10% FNP, and 17% WDR)[/spoiler].

[h1]Lore and Design Philosophy[/h1]
This is a collection of my thoughts for those interested. Feel free to skip this section.

[spoiler]Turns out there's not a lot of things to go off of when your main mention is in RPG rulebooks. Most of these worked, but there were some things I had to head canon to make things work.

Even just choosing the weapon took a while. Dark Heresy rulebooks gave them the Sollex Pattern IX "Death Light" which seems like some ancient mega lasgun, and it seems like this was for simplicity with the Dark Heresy rules rather than an actual statement, especially since that lasgun is made only in one of the hives used in Dark Heresy. Then Deathwatch and Only War rulebooks say they use the standard M36 lasgun. Ok that can work but they wear carapace, so they can't be an early unit, and unlocking T4 infantry with just lasguns is a bit underwhelming. Then there's the grenade launchers, but having those without multiple ammo types is a waste, and having 8 versatile grenade launchers is wild. Without the versatility, I think it would be too restrictive and not worth building, especially since I had already wanted to have the prayer restriction/gimmick. If I had both grenade launchers and lasguns cyclable, there were rarely be a reason to use lasguns outside of overwatch, which I felt was unfun. That leaves them as a powerful ability with a cooldown.
Ok back to lasguns. I could just make a hotshot lasgun clone, but a lot of art depicts the lasguns as similar to a bolter. The imagery is too cool to leave as a scion clone, and I have made a few of those already. That's why I opted to make them a late-game infantry unit, which also makes it more reasonable to have Guardsman squad sizes with bolters and grenade launchers. Even with those numbers, just plain bolters was weak against Paragon Warsuits and other peers, so I bumped the penetration to hotshot levels. Even in the lategame, grenades every turn felt like too much, and making them useless outside of grenade cooldown felt bad. So in the end, it's a hotshot lasgun with a damage buff. To justify that, I made up the weapon lore.

With weapons done, I had mentioned I already wanted the prayer gimmick. Implementing that wasn't completely straightforward since I realized you could just build them and never pray, so you never get the malus from losing [i]Prayed[/i], and there was not much reason to start praying. I thought about making the bonuses only apply when [i]Prayed[/i] is active, but grenade launchers were versatile enough that only using that was acceptable. That's why I added the [i]Warp Travel Sickness[/i], which gets removed on the first time you pray. Mechanically, that works. Lorewise, it's a bit odd that the most faithful are the only ones affected by this, so I made up something that may or may not be true.

Finally, they're religious fanatics. I could just copy typical Imperial prayers and leave it at that, but I feel like that'd be a waste of their historical influence. In the real world, Janissaries were the elite infantry of the Ottoman Empire. We can brush past the whole levying children part and skip to the end where they follow Islam. Naturally, I'd give these units a Muslim influence in the flavour text. Now the only problem is that I am woefully uneducated on the specifics of prayers in Islam, and especially in translating them from Arabic to bastardise them into 40k. I have a lot more exposure with Christianity, so the flavour text used here is a blend of both.[/spoiler]
