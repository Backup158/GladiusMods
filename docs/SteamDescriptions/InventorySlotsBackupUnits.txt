Adds inventory slots support for my custom units.

My patches will slightly diverge from these. I added the inventory slots regardless of whether the unit was a transport or not, even though that causes the UI to overlap (which means you'll need to click and drag the menus away). I had already decided I was ok with this when I made the Fortress of the Arrogance for the Armageddon Steel Legion.

I also made the decision to handle my units based on [url=https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=3419109732]Reinforcements - Increased Group Sizes for lowcost Units[/url] differently from regular units. Since these were made to be two units in one, I have given them double the slots. I figured that if you wanted to spend the influence to arm a Battalion of Praetorian Guardsmen with 12 items (which, remember, do not stack if you have duplicates), that would be up to you haha.

[h1]Load Order and Requirements[/h1]
This patch should work anywhere, but I recommend placing it before (i.e. visually higher) than my units. You don't need to use all of my units; it will just patch whichever ones you use. If you don't use all my mods, there will be some errors in the logs and Compendium, but you can ignore those.
This patch's location in relation to Skirata's mod doesn't matter.
Such as
[code]
...
Backup Units + Inventory for All Units (n)
...
Armageddon Steel Legion
Praetorian Guard
...
Inventory for All Units (n Slots)
...
[/code]

Technically, this doesn't require Skirata's mods, but using this without them doesn't make sense lol.
