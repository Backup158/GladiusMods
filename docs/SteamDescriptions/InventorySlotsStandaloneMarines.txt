This patch should work anywhere, but I recommend placing it before (i.e. visually higher) than the patched mods. You don't need to use every patched mod; it will just patch whichever ones you use. If you don't use all my mods, there will be some errors in the logs and Compendium, but you can ignore those.
This patch's location in relation to Skirata's mod doesn't matter (technically, this doesn't require Skirata's mods, but using this without them doesn't make sense lol).
