[h1]Installation[/h1]
This patch should work anywhere, but I recommend placing it before (i.e. visually higher) than the patched mods. I've had reports where not using all factions will make you crash, so use the standalone patches if that's the case. 
It's ok if you don't use the Ultima Founding patches; it will just patch whichever units you use. There will be some errors in the logs and Compendium, but you can ignore those.

This patch's location in relation to Skirata's mod doesn't matter (technically, this doesn't require Skirata's mods, but using this without them doesn't make sense lol).
