Adds various units from the Drookian Fen Guard to the Astra Militarum, with emphasis on scouting and harassment. 
Natives of the bog world of Drook VI, members of the Drookian Fen Guard have become experts at operating behind enemy lines. They work in small squads to move quickly, ambushing unsuspecting foes[spoiler]([i]Drookian[/i]: +2 Accuracy when Overwatching, +17% Damage in Forests)[/spoiler]. Beyond simple ambushes, they also conduct night-time raids to demoralize the enemy[spoiler]([i]Backline Harassment[/i]: Choose an enemy within 3 tiles to give them [i]Harassed[/i] for 3 turns. [i]Harassed[/i]: -1 Morale, -17% Accuracy)[/spoiler]. Instead of merely taking potshots, Drookian Scouts can choose to up the ante by taking the enemy's supplies[spoiler]([i]Waylay[/i]: Choose an enemy within 2 tiles to give them [i]Undersupplied[/i] for 3 turns and to gain [i]Spoils of War[/i] for 3 turns. [i]Undersupplied[/i]: +17% Resource Upkeep, -2 Morale, -25% Attacks. [i]Spoils of War[/i]: -30% Resource Upkeep)[/spoiler].
Drookians are also adept saboteurs, armed with Melta Bombs[spoiler](Unlocked at T4, Hotshot Power Packs)[/spoiler] and able to spot weaknesses in enemy structures[spoiler]([i]Drookian Saboteur[/i]: +50% Damage against Fortifications, +25% Damage against Vehicles)[/spoiler].
However, the harsh conditions of Drook VI have shifted Drookian mentality away from that of the wider Imperium. When you're waist-deep in swamp water with deadly fauna and rivals all around, faith in the God-Emperor takes a backseat to loyalty to your clan. They have a deep distrust of foreigners, which makes it difficult for them to work with other Guard regiments[spoiler]([i]Drookian[/i]: -1 Morale when adjacent to non-Drookian allies)[/spoiler] unless properly... motivated[spoiler]([i]Drookian[/i]: +1 Morale when within 2 tiles of an allied Commissar)[/spoiler]. 

No custom models. Chances of me making them are slim (because I'm lazy and don't want to learn Blender). Drookian Assassins use Chaos Cultist models, Drookian Hover-Chimeras use Land Speeder models (with the Space Marines inside lol), and all other units use Guardsman models.
