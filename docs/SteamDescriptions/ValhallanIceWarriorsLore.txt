There's a decent amount of lore on the Valhallans, mainly in the Ciaphas Cain books. Unfortunately, I have not read those yet, so I had to rely on wikis for information. That was enough for the overarching vision, but I wanted to fill in some of the details.

Looking at their general culture and aesthetics, they're pretty clearly influenced by the Red Army (more specifically, how the Red Army was portrayed in media). Given that, I blended real aspects of history with exaggerations from pop culture.
