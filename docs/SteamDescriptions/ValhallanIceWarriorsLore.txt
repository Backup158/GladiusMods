There's a decent amount of lore on the Valhallans, mainly in the Ciaphas Cain books. Unfortunately, I have not read those yet, so I had to rely on wikis for information. That was enough for the overarching vision, but I wanted to fill in some of the details.
I purposely left out named characters because Heroes of Legend does it great already.

Looking at their general culture and aesthetics, they're pretty clearly influenced by the Red Army (more specifically, how the Red Army was portrayed in media). Given that, I blended real aspects of history with exaggerations from pop culture. Considering the depth of information available on that, I focused on World War II (The Great Patriotic War).
