Cities are harder to take when there are more units around them.

For each allied unit within 2 tiles, cities gain:
> +3% City Damage Resistance, up to +34%
> -0.7% Morale Loss, up to 80%
> Additional action points, up to 4

That means when there are 11 defending units nearby, the bonuses are maxxed out.
To make the final calculations nicer for the percentages, the buffs from the 11th unit have an increased effect[spoiler](+4% City DR, +10% morale loss reduction)[/spoiler]. Additional actions are granted at 3 allies, 7 allies, and 11 allies.

[h1]So why this?[/h1]
I like Simple Fortified Cities but found the damage resistance excessive when there were no units nearby. After killing the defending army, I would need to fully surround the enemy city with tanks and bombard the city for a few turns. While this is very appropriate for a siege (as that's one of the stated goals), it made early game aggression nearly impossible in my experience. Since I use [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2832703933]Squad Broken[/url], sending infantry against a city would end up with two shots taking out a unit (typically a decently-levelled one) and having the third shot cripple another unit, breaking everyone's morale. The choices then were to either have enough units to cycle out and grind down the city with attrition (while the enemy can still produce fresh troops right there) or research more techs to get some ranged damage reduction source or mid to late game units. Personally I really like early game infantry assaults, and I'd like that to be viable with my mod setup.
I really like how We Own These Cities scales, and the only reason I didn't use it was that I liked the increased actions from Simple Fortified Cities a bit more (and having both at once was overkill). I had just accepted the grind, but over time I'd rather not have to slog through cities after I had already faced a wave of enemies (which I like to increase the size of with some other mods and game settings). So I combined them here.

I also added the morale loss reduction because of Squad Broken. What would happen is that there would be a wave of defenders and a city with 3 shots. I'd kill a bunch of defenders, and the city would be broken, making those 3 shots much weaker, even when there's another few waves of defenders behind the city.
