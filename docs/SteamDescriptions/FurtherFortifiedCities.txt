Cities are harder to take when there are more units around them.

[h1]Heavily inspired by[/h1]
[url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3254778715]Simple Fortified Cities[/url] (SFC)

[h1]Added Effects[/h1]
For each allied unit within 2 tiles, cities gain:
> +3% City Damage Resistance (CDR), up to +34%
> -0.8% Morale Loss Factor, up to 90%
> Additional action points, up to 4
For each allied Hero within 2 tiles, cities gain:
> +3 morale per turn, up to +9

That means when there are 11 defending units nearby, the bonuses are maxxed out.
To make the final calculations nicer for the percentages, the buffs from the 11th unit have an increased effect[spoiler](+4% CDR, +10% morale loss reduction; cities already have 33% CDR, so this makes it 67%)[/spoiler]. Additional actions are granted at 3 allies, 7 allies, and 11 allies.

[h1]So why this?[/h1]
Basically it's to tailor these two mods to my playstyle and modlist.

I like SFC but found the damage resistance excessive when there were no units nearby. After killing the defending army, I would need to fully surround the enemy city with tanks and bombard the city for a few turns. While this is very appropriate for a siege (as that's one of the stated goals), it made early game aggression nearly impossible in my experience. Since I use [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2832703933]Squad Broken[/url], sending infantry against a city would end up with two shots taking out a unit (typically a decently-levelled one) and having the third shot cripple another unit, breaking everyone's morale. The choices then were to either have enough units to cycle out and grind down the city with attrition (while the enemy can still produce fresh troops right there) or research more techs to get some ranged damage reduction source or mid to late game units. Personally I really like early game infantry assaults, and I'd like that to be viable with my mod setup, so that makes option 2 undesirable (though that's what I did before). Option 1 is not happening since I like having the AI produce hordes of units (and I set my settings and modlist to support that), which makes option 1 impossible.

I really like how WOTC scales, and with the resistance scaling with units present, that previously-discussed choice is no longer forced. The only reason I didn't use it was that I liked the increased actions from SFC a bit more, and having both at once was overkill. I had just accepted the grind, but over time, I found that I'd rather not have to slog through cities after I had already faced a wave of enemies. So that's why I merged them here[spoiler](WOTC used Feel No Pain damage reduction while SFC used CDR, and I went with the CDR)[/spoiler].

I also added the morale loss reduction because of Squad Broken. What would happen is that there would be a wave of defenders and a city with 3 shots. I'd kill a bunch of defenders, and the city would be broken, making those 3 shots much weaker, even when there's another few waves of defenders behind the city. I figured a city would be fine sending waves of men to their deaths as long as there's more meat for the grinder. I originally had this at 100% but I figured there's a point at which the city defenders would grow weary of watching the meat grinder (even though it's 40k), where they'd eventually break even with constant reinforcements.
