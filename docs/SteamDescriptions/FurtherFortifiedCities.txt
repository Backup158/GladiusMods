Cities are harder to take when there are more units around them.

For each allied unit within 2 tiles, cities gain:
> +3% City Damage Resistance, up to +34%
> -0.9% Morale Loss, up to 100%
> Additional action points, up to 4

That means when there are 11 defending units nearby, the bonuses are maxxed out.
To make the final calculations nicer for the percentages, the buffs from the 11th unit have an increased effect (e.g. +4% City DR instead of +3%). Additional actions are granted at 3 allies, 7 allies, and 11 allies.

I like Simple Fortified Cities but found the damage resistance excessive when there were no units nearby. After killing the defending army, I would need to fully surround the enemy city with tanks and bombard the city for a few turns. Very appropriate for a siege, but it made early game aggression nearly impossible in my experience.
I really like the idea with We Own These Cities, and the only reason I didn't use it was that I liked the increased actions from Simple Fortified Cities a bit more. I had just accepted the grind, but over time I'd rather not have to slog through cities after I had already faced a wave of enemies (which I like to increase the size of with some other mods and game settings). So I combined them here.

I also added the morale loss reduction because I use Squad Broken. What would happen is that there would be a wave of defenders and a city with 3 shots. I'd kill a bunch of defenders, and the city would be broken, making those 3 shots much weaker, even when there's another few waves of defenders behind the city.
