Adds [b]Steel Legionnaires[/b] (Guardsman alternative) and [b]Steel Legion Storm Troopers[/b] (Tempestus Scions alternative) to the Astra Militarum. 
Steel Legion troopers are experts in rapid deployment from APCs, gaining boosts upon disembark ([i]Armageddon Rapid Deployment[/i]: +1 Movement for 2 turns, +17% damage for 1 turn). Unlocks more boosts through the research tree.
Their Voss Pattern Lasguns have shortened barrels and foldable wire stocks, which makes then easy to fit inside a Chimera but reduces their range. 
Years of fighting Orks on Armageddon has made them more effective against their nemesis ([i]Ork Hunter[/i]: +17% damage vs Orks).

No custom models. Chances of me making them are slim (because I'm lazy and don't want to learn Blender).

[h1]Research Unlocks[/h1]
