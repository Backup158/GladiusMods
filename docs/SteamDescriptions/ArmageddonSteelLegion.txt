Adds various infantry and vehicles of the Armageddon Steel Legion to the Astra Militarum. 

The backbone of Steel Legion doctrine is their usage of mechanised infantry. Armageddon's numerous factories produce waves of vehicles, which means they can readily equip the Steel Legion with plentiful Chimeras and supporting tanks. Steel Legionnaires sit cooped up in the back of Chimeras, following the main armoured force. Leman Russ main battle tanks pour heavy fire into enemy lines, punching a hole in their defences. Before the enemy can close this wound, APCs and IFVs rush through guns blazing, as the tanks continue laying on fire. Before the dust can settle, Steel Legionnaires pour out of their transports to deepen this wound.

[h1]Units added[/h1]
Years of fighting Orks on Armageddon has made them more effective against their nemesis[spoiler]([i]Member of the Steel Legion[/i]: +17% accuracy vs Orks)[/spoiler]. Steel Legion infantry are experts in rapid deployment from APCs, gaining boosts upon disembark[spoiler]([i]Armageddon Rapid Deployment[/i]: +1 Movement for 2 turns, +17% damage for 1 turn)[/spoiler], with further boosts unlocked through the research tree.

[table]
[tr]
[b]Steel Legionnaires[/b] (Guardsman alternative) are the basic infantry. Their Voss Pattern Lasguns have shortened barrels and foldable wire stocks, which makes then easy to fit inside a Chimera but reduces their range. 
[/tr]
[tr]
[b]Steel Legion Purgation Squads[/b] are Steel Legionnaires specialising in clearing out Orks. Armed with flamers, they burn away foes, moving or not. They are able to clear out Orkoid Fungus and Forests[spoiler]([u]Purging Flames[u]: Target an adjacent tile to burn away Orkoid Fungus and/or Forests)[/spoiler]. 
[/tr]
[tr]
[b]Armageddon Pattern Chimeras[/b] are tougher and can more easily slip behind enemy lines[spoiler](Ignores enemy Zone of Control)[/spoiler]. As such, they cost a bit more to produce.
[/tr]
[tr]
[b]Steel Legion Commissars[/b] lead both infantry and vehicles. They grant passive buffs, which lends well to sitting safely inside a Chimera. Buffs are increased for members of the Steel Legion.
[u]Steel Legion Discipline[/u]: Adjacent troops gain accuracy. Weaker than the typical Aura of Discipline, unless the affected troop is in the Steel Legion.
[u]Armoured Fist[/u]: Adjacent vehicles gain armour and have less ore upkeep.
[u]Aura of Command[/u]: Troops within 2 tiles gain morale and have reduced morale loss. The Commissar and any transport they're in have increased ranged damage reduction. 
[u]Combined Arms[/u]: Elite. Infantry and vehicles within 2 tiles gain defences. Infantry gain ranged damage reduction when adjacent to vehicles; vehicles, melee damage reduction when adjacent to infantry.
[/tr]
[tr]
[b]Armageddon Ork Hunters[/b] are close-ranged infantry trained to fight in forests and kill Orks. They can plant anti-infantry traps[spoiler]([u]Place Punji Traps[/u]: Place a trap without consuming movement)[/spoiler] and be armed with Melta Bombs after further research. Years of battling with the Greenskins have made them not so different from their foe, granting them Ork-like traits and the ability to use Ork weapons.
[b]Punji Traps[/b] can be placed on land. Similar to Cluster Mines, they cannot be triggered by skimming units. Any infantry stepping on it will be [i]Crippled[/i], slowing them down and making them bleed [spoiler](for 2 turns, -67% movement and -3 hitpoints per turn)[/spoiler]. Vehicles can stop on traps to destroy them without taking damage.
[/tr]
[tr]
[b]Steel Legion Storm Troopers[/b] (Tempestus Scions alternative)
[/tr]
[/table]

No custom models. Chances of me making them are slim (because I'm lazy and don't want to learn Blender).

There is a standalone Fortress of Arrogance mod (from the [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3104947090]Rogue Trader unit pack[/url]) on the Workshop already. I wanted to have my own implementation for abilities (and looking at the comments, it has some issues), but that one has a custom model, if you prefer that.
