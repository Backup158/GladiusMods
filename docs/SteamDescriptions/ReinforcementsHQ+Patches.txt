You don't have to install all of them; it'll only patch the ones you have installed. It will put some messages in the game log for the missing factions, but you can ignore them.

[b]Load Order[/b]
Shouldn't matter but I have these above (visually higher) the faction mods and HQ+. ex:
[code]
HQ+Core Unit for Reinforcements Series Factions
Reinforcements - World Eaters
HQ+Core Unit Production
[/code]

[b]Why Not the Titans?[/b]
Since the HQ is a unit, it's not as simple as adding the production to it. I'd have to create a custom ability based on the regular infantry ability, which while not difficult, would require more testing to make sure it works and won't crash if you didn't install [i]Reinforcements - Collegia Titanica[/i].
If that condition is satisfied, I'll update it here. Otherwise, it'll go into a separate mod (if I even make it since I don't even play much Gladius nowadays .-.)
