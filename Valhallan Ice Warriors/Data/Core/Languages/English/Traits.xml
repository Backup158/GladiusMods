    <entry name="AstraMilitarum/Valhallan" value="Valhallan"/>
    <entry name="AstraMilitarum/ValhallanDescription" value="Decreased morale loss. Increased damage resistance when fighting in Arctic and Tundra tiles, but increased upkeep and damage taken when in Desert, Savannah, and Volcanic tiles. Increased armour when in Cities, Imperial Ruins, and Outposts. Accuracy is increased when fighting Orks."/>
    <entry name="AstraMilitarum/ValhallanFlavor" value="Hailing from the frigid ice world of Valhalla, the Valhallan Ice Warriors are stubborn defenders who operate in large numbers and thrive in Arctic conditions. After comets plunged the planet into the cold, humanity retreated underground into caves to survive. Soon after, the Orks landed, and the Valhallans stubbornly held onto every inch, fighting to the last man. Modern Valhallans honour their history by continuing to value resiliency and especially hating the Orks."/>
    <entry name="AstraMilitarum/ValhallanHorde" value="Massed Infantry"/>
    <entry name="AstraMilitarum/ValhallanHordeDescription" value="Movement is increased when within 5 tiles of an allied city, within 2 tiles of allied Hero, or within 3 tiles of 4 other Valhallans. Accuracy is decreased when alone, less so when adjacent to 1 ally, and neutral when adjacent to 2 or more allies."/>
    <entry name="AstraMilitarum/ValhallanHordeFlavor" value="Valhallan Ice Warriors primarily operate in mass numbers, with every training exercise involving multiple units. In great numbers, morale is kept high, and the increased confidence makes taking accurate shots easier, plus being able to trust the flanks are watched. When formations are crushed, shots may not always find their marks, but Valhallans can be relied upon to die before surrendering a position."/>

    <entry name="AstraMilitarum/GrowingNumbersDescription" value="Increases squad size by: 1 at <string name='Upgrades/AstraMilitarum/FoodEdict'/>, 1 at <string name='Upgrades/AstraMilitarum/GrowthEdict'/>, 2 at <string name='Upgrades/AstraMilitarum/BruteShield'/>, 2 at <string name='Upgrades/AstraMilitarum/HammerOfWrath'/>, and 3 at <string name='Upgrades/AstraMilitarum/LoyaltyEdict'/>."/>

    <entry name="AstraMilitarum/Conscripts" value="Conscripted"/>
    <entry name="AstraMilitarum/ConscriptsDescription" value="Allies do not lose morale when this unit is killed. Upon becoming Broken, this unit flees the battlefield. When an allied Commissar is within 2 tiles, this unit has no Influence upkeep."/>
    <entry name="AstraMilitarum/ConscriptsFlavor" value="Degenerates and criminals may not be able to produce much value in a manufactorum, but they're still useful as somewhat warm bodies to throw at machine gun nests. Nobody will miss them, but nearby units may find their equipment missing if they don't watch out for conniving conscripts. Even if they don't steal everything that isn't nailed down, conscripts cannot be relied upon to die standing for the Emperor. When the going is rough, they're known to flee, and whether the Commissars can cut them down fast enough or not, the unit is lost either way."/>
    <entry name="AstraMilitarum/ValhallanSniper" value="Urban Marksmen"/>
    <entry name="AstraMilitarum/ValhallanSniperDescription" value="Increased effectiveness against enemy infantry in Cities, Imperial Ruins, or Outposts (not counting grenades). Can move one tile after shooting, if within 3 tiles of an allied Headquarters."/>
    <entry name="AstraMilitarum/ValhallanSniperFlavor" value="Nobody is safe from Valhallan Sharpshooters, and they make sure everyone knows that. Sharpshooters have honed their eyes quickly find the best positions in cities and where to strike from. Officers and weapon specialists are obvious targets, but even typical grunts can find themselves bleeding out with a gut shot. While it's not the best move tactically, fear spreads faster than even promethium-fuelled flames."/>
    <entry name="AstraMilitarum/UrbanTankAmbush" value="Urban Anti-tank Ambush"/>
    <entry name="AstraMilitarum/UrbanTankAmbushDescription" value="Increased effectiveness against enemy vehicles in Cities, Imperial Ruins, or Outposts (not counting grenades). Can move one tile after shooting, if within 3 tiles of an allied Headquarters."/>
    <entry name="AstraMilitarum/UrbanTankAmbushFlavor" value="Every crack in a building could be concealing an anti-tank rifle. Inexperienced tank crews may find themselves carelessly rolling into a street, unaware of the 8 anti-tank rifles aimed at their weakspots."/>
    <entry name="AstraMilitarum/ValhallanShockTrooper" value="Urban Shock Troops"/>
    <entry name="AstraMilitarum/ValhallanShockTrooperDescription" value="Takes less damage when moving. Increased damage and increased melee attacks against enemy units (besides the Headquarters itself) in Cities, Imperial Ruins, or Outposts."/>
    <entry name="AstraMilitarum/ValhallanShockTrooperFlavor" value="Shock Armies are trained and deployed to assault hardened positions in urban environments. They are accustomed to clearing winding streets with moderately high casualties."/>
    <entry name="AstraMilitarum/ValhallanFrontovik" value="Hardened Veteran"/>
    <entry name="AstraMilitarum/ValhallanFrontovikDescription" value="Unit has increased damage resistance when adjacent to 2 allies, which is increased if those allies are Valhallans. If the unit has not moved, Rapid Fire applies at all ranges."/>
    <entry name="AstraMilitarum/ValhallanFrontovikFlavor" value="The most experienced Valhallan grunts know that while dying for the Emperor is glorious, it's more effective to focus on taking as many enemy lives first. The Emperor only asks that we die standing, but it's a lot easier to make that a worthwhile trade when positioned in cover overlooking a kill zone."/>

Investigations reveal heavy intoxication, with many Valhallans not even sobering up after beatings. After thorough interrogation, the Inquisition has found not Chaos taint, but simple incompetance. Valhallan commanders were fuelling continuous mass-infantry assaults with alcohol, until the men of these regiments were physically incapable of distinguishing between friend and foe. The offending regiments have been punished by decimation, the commanders have been stripped of rank and servitorised, and the unaffected regiments have been assigned to whipping duty.&quot; - Interrogator Pachek"/>

Typically, prisoners are sent into dangerous mines, with freedom promised if they can deliver enough ore by the end of the month. Unofficially, backstabbing is overlooked since it helps control the constantly growing traitor population.
