    <entry name="AstraMilitarum/UraDescription" value="Inspires Valhallans within 3 tiles to advance with decreased morale loss, increased damage, and increased damage resistance. Requires 4 allied infantry (where at least 2 of those are Valhallans) within 3 tiles to activate."/>
    <entry name="AstraMilitarum/UraFlavor" value="Many foes know what it's like to face a mass infantry charge. Typically, these will be uncoordinated hordes of flesh firing inaccurately, which makes for easy pickings for well-fortified positions. Valhallans are the exception. After hours of being pummelled by artillery, beleaguered defenders will hear a hearty cry of &quot;URAAAAA!&quot; before an endless wave of Valhallans descends upon them. Inexplicably, these mere men and women seem harder to kill, with some reports of prisoners swearing they shot someone thrice in the chest without the Valhallan falling."/>

    <entry name="AstraMilitarum/GulagFlavor" value="Prisoners, whether they be enemies from within or from without, cost resources to maintain. They must be fed, sheltered, and most importantly, monitored. The only way to make this more worthwhile than simply putting a las-bolt through the head is to find a way to extract value. Valhallan planetary governors established forced labour camps to intern enemies of the state, and while there is no shortage of those, certain prisoners of war or seditious Guardsmen may find their way to these camps, where they dig through the icy ground until they themselves are a part of it."/>

    <entry name="AstraMilitarum/ThePeoplesCommissarFlavor" value="Typically, Valhallan senior leadership enforce discipline by the point of many bolt pistols.

Good Marshals know too much honey will fatten the men beyond usefulness; bad ones don't live long enough to internalise this lesson.
