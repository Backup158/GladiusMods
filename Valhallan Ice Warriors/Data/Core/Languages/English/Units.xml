    <entry name="AstraMilitarum/ValhallanGuardsmanFlavor" value="Valhallans are a rowdy bunch. While they may not be the best trained and equipped regiment in the Guard, they make up for it in tenacity and sheer numbers. Every Ice Warrior survived a childhood of living underground in a frozen wasteland, where many families struggled to put food on the table. Out of necessity, even the lowest Valhallan Guardsman is resilient and adept in cold environments. They will hold the line and make the enemy pay for every inch taken."/>

    <entry name="AstraMilitarum/ValhallanConscriptsDescription" value="Weak, cheap infantry unit available in great numbers. Influence upkeep is negated when near a Commissar. This unit is weaker when alone. Unit must pay Ore to use grenades."/>
    <entry name="AstraMilitarum/ValhallanConscriptsFlavor" value="When the Orks struck after Valhalla's climate completely shifted, every man, woman, and child was mobilised in its defence. The planetary governor signed a general order calling for the conscription of every able-bodied adult, including criminals accused of non-violent crimes. Those who could not work were sent to the front with old pistols and makeshift melee weapons, where they will be thrust directly into the enemy lines. Success comes only through sheer numbers, and everyone knows their chance at survival is slim. Most have stopped caring and will steal whatever they can to increase their chance at survival; Commissars must be assigned to these units to ensure these illicit actions won't happen without punishment."/>

    <entry name="AstraMilitarum/ValhallanSharpshootersDescription" value="Sniper infantry unit that specialises in urban warfare."/>
    <entry name="AstraMilitarum/ValhallanSharpshootersFlavor" value="The Valhallan Ice Warriors were among the first regiments to train snipers. General doctrine emphasises volume of fire from a horde of infantry, which leaves a gap in true precision operations. Sharpshooters fill that gap. Whether it be from behind a mound of snow or from the 34th story of a manufactorum, Valhallan Sharpshooters will find their marks."/>
    <entry name="AstraMilitarum/ValhallanAntiTankRiflemen" value="Valhallan Anti-Tank Rifle Squad"/>
    <entry name="AstraMilitarum/ValhallanAntiTankRiflemenDescription" value="Infantry unit armed with semi-automatic anti-tank rifles. This unit is weaker when alone."/>
    <entry name="AstraMilitarum/ValhallanAntiTankRiflemenFlavor" value="While missile launchers are versatile and powerful, they are expensive to produce and can cause undue collatoral damage. When numbers are the main strategy, cheaper is often better. Anti-tank rifles, given good positioning, can deal just as much if not more damage to enemy armour than traditional sapper squads. In the caverns of Valhalla, Orkish vehicles found themselves squeezing through numerous twists and turns, where crevices often contained pockets of ambushers. Missiles and grenades may have caused collapses, which aren't always the best outcome. Conversely, a wall of anti-tank rifles firing as quickly as possible will tear through a Killa Kan without risking sealing the city underground."/>
    <entry name="AstraMilitarum/ValhallanHeavyGunnerSquad" value="Valhallan Heavy Stubber Squad"/>
    <entry name="AstraMilitarum/ValhallanHeavyGunnerSquadDescription" value="Infantry unit armed with heavy machine guns, which can be configured to shoot down airborne foes. This unit is weaker when alone."/>
    <entry name="AstraMilitarum/ValhallanHeavyGunnerSquadFlavor" value="Valhallans typically mount heavy machine guns on vehicles for anti-aircraft duties, but infantry can carry them on tripods to wield similar power. While it's cumbersome and requires additional setup compared to traditional infantry automatic weapons, many units will gladly accpet this for the versatility gained once setup. It turns out that rounds that can punch through Dakkajet wings can rip through an Ork's skull just as easily."/>
    <entry name="AstraMilitarum/ValhallanFlameTroopers" value="Valhallan Flame Troopers"/>
    <entry name="AstraMilitarum/ValhallanFlameTroopersDescription" value="Light infantry unit armed with flamers. This unit is weaker when alone."/>
    <entry name="AstraMilitarum/ValhallanFlameTroopersFlavor" value="When you have problems on an ice world, sometimes all you need is a flamer. Entrance is frozen over? Flamer. The gears of machinery are freezing and stopping the assembly line? Flamer. Orks chopping at the gate? Flamer. Political dissidents sowing foment amongst the workers? Flamer!"/>
    <entry name="AstraMilitarum/ValhallanHoundMaster" value="Valhallan Hound Masters"/>
    <entry name="AstraMilitarum/ValhallanHoundMasterDescription" value="Light infantry unit that can spawn dogs, which can be specialised as scouts or as anti-armour suicide bombers. This unit is weaker when alone."/>
    <entry name="AstraMilitarum/ValhallanHoundMasterFlavor" value="Dogs are some of the smartest animals, as proven by their choice to serve the Imperium. Wild dogs prowl the frozen surface of Valhalla, returning to their caves with prey between their jaws. Humans took note of this, and some conscripted these dogs to hunt for them in exchange for treats and fires during the night. The Valhallan Ice Warriors adopted this behavior into regiment, training these dogs as scouts and lethal weapons."/>

    <entry name="AstraMilitarum/ValhallanDogsScoutFlavor" value="Despite the cold air suppressing the travel of odours, the nose of a hound is still much stronger than a man's. Additionally, dogs have a lower profile and can slip below the gaze enemy sentries easier than a man can."/>

    <entry name="AstraMilitarum/ValhallanAntiTankDogsKrakDescription" value="Dogs strapped with Krak Grenades. Unit is killed upon attacking."/>
    <entry name="AstraMilitarum/ValhallanAntiTankDogsKrakFlavor" value="Valhallan units experimented with arming dogs with anti-tank explosives. Initial trials were conducted by training dogs to follow the scent of fuel, then being released with timed explosives. It turns out that Guard vehicles also burn fuel, which is even worsened when the enemy uses captured vehicles. Being unable to differentiate between friend and foe led to many allied tankers being blown sky high by the Valhallans, leading to many cases of bad blood and executions. Even without this issue, there were numerous cases where the dogs would become frightened by the sounds of real war and run back to their masters, do the enemy's job for them. Now, their explosives are triggered on biting, and the dogs are trained to bite targets their handlers point out. While not always reliable, it has led to much fewer cases of friendly fire, which is all that matters in the game of large numbers."/>

    <entry name="AstraMilitarum/ValhallanAntiTankDogsMeltaFlavor" value="&quot;After-action Report Sigma-Gamma 83: Sergeant Kowalski's hounds completely disabled a heretic Land Raider. Upon pict-caster analysis, footage shows Kowalski had armed his dogs with melta bombs. Investigations revealed these were stolen from a nearby Adepta Sororitas stronghold. While the results speak for themselves, theft from the Emperor's inventory must be punished. Verdict: post-humously award the dogs and reassign the Sergeant to a penal battalion.&quot;"/>

    <entry name="AstraMilitarum/ValhallanMortarTeamFlavor" value="Before an infantry charge, it's best to soften them up with artillery. However, traditional artillery may be destroyed by counter batteries or are otherwise unavailable. Mortar teams are readily available and can quickly lob shells from right behind the frontline."/>

    <entry name="AstraMilitarum/ValhallanShockTroopsDescription" value="Elite shock infantry unit. Most effective against light infantry."/>
    <entry name="AstraMilitarum/ValhallanShockTroopsFlavor" value="High command noticed that a wave of infantry wasn't always the most efficient method of taking an entrenched position. Many commanders didn't care. A taken position was a taken position afterall. A few, not wanting to waste the Emperor's currency, secretly formulated plans to train specialised units to lead the attack more effectively. These became the Shock Armies, and they were given better equipment and trained to close the distance by using cover."/>

They are the hardiest and deadliest among the Valhallan Ice Warriors, having survived the toughest battles. Only once they have been forged by the frontline may they earn the name Frontovik."/>
