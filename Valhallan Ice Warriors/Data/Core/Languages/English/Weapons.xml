    <entry name="ValhallanAntiTankRifleFlavor" value="When the Ork waves first hit Valhalla, planetary defences had a wealth of men and materiel to throw against the enemy. As time dragged on, high-quality equipment was destroyed beyond repair or even captured by the brutish foe. Orders were given to acquire a new anti-armour weapons system to pierce through the crude yet effective enemy armoured forces. The Adeptus Mechanicus contingent searched far and wide, but it was two renowned enginseers, Simonov and Degtyaryov, who uncovered an elegant solution. The designs were of ballistic rifles, upsized for larger rounds, where one design yielded a less robust weapon that was cheaper to build. High command was pleased by this discovery, and these weapons were nicknamed after the two enginseers."/>

    <entry name="ValhallanHeavyStubberFlavor" value="Valhallans utilize versatile heavy machines across the infantry and armoured units, based on an ancient design that was restored by enginseer Degtyaryov. The DShK can be mounted on tripods for infantry use or mounted directly on vehicles. It comes with large ring sights to aim at airborne targets, and troops have been known to bring down Deffkoptas with sheer volume of fire."/>
