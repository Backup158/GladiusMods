    <entry name="AstraMilitarum/DrookianFlavor" value="Hardened by the harsh swamps of their homeworld, Drookians are expert ambushers and scouts. With this lifetime of wading through swamps, Drookians have also learned that any lofty ideals of &quot;humanity's brotherhood&quot; are barely worth the paper they're printed on. Drookians find that true loyality and brotherhood is found within your clan, making them greatly distrusting of foreigners. While individually courageous, when the cards are on the table, they would much rather flee and live for their clan. To die for some distant, uncaring God-Emperor, they need proper... motivation."/>
