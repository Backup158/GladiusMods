	<entry name="AstraMilitarum/SteelLegionnaireFlavor" value="Steel Legionnaires, hailing from Armageddon, are masters of mechanised warfare. Their doctrine revolves around rapid deployments from APCs, namely Chimeras, to disrupt enemy forces before they can muster a defence. Steel Legionnaires wield Voss Pattern Lasguns, which sacrifice range for a smaller profile that leaves more space in a troop transport. Due to their experience in the Third War for Armageddon, Steel Legionnaires are experts at fighting Orks."/>
