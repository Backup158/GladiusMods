	<entry name="AstraMilitarum/SteelLegionnaireFlavor" value="Steel Legionnaires, hailing from Armageddon, are masters of mechanised warfare. Their doctrine revolves around rapid deployments from APCs, namely Chimeras, to disrupt enemy forces before they can muster a defence. Steel Legionnaires wield Voss Pattern Lasguns, which sacrifice range for a smaller profile that leaves more space in a troop transport. Due to their experience in the Third War for Armageddon, Steel Legionnaires are experts at fighting Orks."/>

	<entry name="AstraMilitarum/ArmageddonOrkHuntersFlavor" value="On Armageddon, the strongest survivors from destroyed units are formed into the Armageddon Ork Hunters. They are thrust into dense jungles, where they constantly battle Orks in a futile attempt to quell the tide. Not for a lack of effort, though. They live and breathe warfare and extermination. In fact, they are so accustomed to slaughtering Orks, they have become not so different from the very foe they face."/>

	<entry name="AstraMilitarum/SteelLegionPurgationSquadFlavor" value="Clearing an area of Orks is a long, uphill battle, making it all the more important to make sure they can't return.
