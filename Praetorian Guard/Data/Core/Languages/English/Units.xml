    <entry name="AstraMilitarum/PraetorianGuardsmen" value="Praetorian Guardsmen"/>
    <entry name="AstraMilitarum/PraetorianGuardsmenDescription" value="Light infantry unit specialising in exterminating Neutrals, with a minor bonus against Orks. They are tougher and braver than the average Guardsman, and they gain bonuses when adjacent to other Praetorians."/>
    <entry name="AstraMilitarum/PraetorianGuardsmenFlavor" value="The Praetorian Guard are renowned across the Imperium for their bravery. Their tight discipline and cooperation in the face of insurmountable odds gives Praetorians the grit to carve their mark in the Astra Militarum. With each Guardsman having experienced a lifetime of cruelty and draconian conditions, eliminating the galaxy's savages seem inviting in comparison. The uncivilised barbarians polluting the galaxy shall pay for their sins of survival."/>
    <entry name="AstraMilitarum/PraetorianGrenadier" value="Praetorian Grenadiers"/>
    <entry name="AstraMilitarum/PraetorianGrenadierDescription" value="Shock infantry unit with increased proficiency in handling grenades. They are tougher than even the average Praetorian, and they are extra resilient when charging headfirst into enemy lines."/>
    <entry name="AstraMilitarum/PraetorianGrenadierFlavor" value="Grenadiers are recruited from the tallest, strongest Praetorian Guardsmen. Traditionally, they were trained as siege experts, but the realities of current conflicts led to their specialisation in breaking through enemy lines. Recognisable by their bearskin caps, they can be typically found storming palisades, knowing no doubt nor fear."/>
    <entry name="AstraMilitarum/PraetorianHeavyGunnerSquad" value="Praetorian Maksim Stubgun Squad"/>
    <entry name="AstraMilitarum/PraetorianHeavyGunnerSquadDescription" value="Infantry unit wielding a heavy weapon that tears through hordes of enemy infantry."/>
    <entry name="AstraMilitarum/PraetorianHeavyGunnerSquadFlavor" value="&quot;We don't take kindly to filthy tribals trying to &apos;settle&apos; or &apos;stay alive&apos; in our God-Emperor-given land.&quot;"/>
    <entry name="AstraMilitarum/PraetorianHussar" value="Praetorian Hussars"/>
    <entry name="AstraMilitarum/PraetorianHussarDescription" value="Fast melee infantry that hunts down fleeing foes."/>
    <entry name="AstraMilitarum/PraetorianHussarFlavor" value="Praetorian Hussars, while relatively recently formed, have their roots in the storied past of the Praetorian Horse Guards."/>
    <entry name="AstraMilitarum/PraetorianCommissar" value="Praetorian Commissar"/>
    <entry name="AstraMilitarum/PraetorianCommissarDescription" value="Hero unit that provides bonuses to nearby allied units. Increased bonuses for Praetorians, but debuffs other, low morale troops."/>
    <entry name="AstraMilitarum/PraetorianCommissarFlavor" value="Praetorians, while no strangers to disproportionately harsh punishments, have their ironclad discipline forged by their Commissars. Praetorian Commissars typically descend from the more fortunate bloodlines in the hives, but that doesn't stop them from planting a boot or bolt shell into a disgraceful soldier."/>
